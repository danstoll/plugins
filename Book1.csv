-send IT tasks to IT Manager, automatically add user to the Azure tenancy and group
-Send HR tasks to HR manager
-Send a contract for signature

Procurement Pathway Tool

The outcome of the workflow (regardless of which option we end up with) is to provide end users with 1 of 3 pathways (ie sub-processes in Promapp) they are required to follow.  

The options are both  based on the corporate risk matrix, just in different ways – one with a set of questions (option 1) and the other being a visual representation that they select from (option 2).  

Option 1 (this is the option we briefly talked through last week):
•	A set of 5 multi choice questions to select the ‘worst case’ of something happening, one for each of the corporate risk matrix categories (with 5 answers to choose from – representative of the 5 risk levels) and 
•	An accompanying likelihood multi choice question (5 answers to choose from)
•	The combination of answers are mapped in the background to 1 of the 3 pathways/sub-processes they need to then follow in Promapp, and the user is advised of that outcome.  

Option 2:
A visual representation of the corporate risk matrix
The user clicks on/selects the most relevant option from each of the categories in the risk matrix
Once they select a box (say for the health & safety column in the risk matrix) they would then be asked to assign the likelihood to that risk (maybe a pop up box or similar to select the likelihood).

Option 3:
Our friends at Nintex choice!  If there is a more user friendly way to get the user to the outcome based on the logic, we’d love to hear it!

I’ve attached the list of questions (word file) and an excel file containing the mapping of the combined answers (ignore columns M onwards for now) to inform the outcome of the workflow.  You’ll note question 1 does not have a corresponding ‘likelihood’ question associated with it, and therefore this is mapped directly into the pathways/outcomes table as A, B, C, D or E.  There is also a question 6, which does not require mapping (it will simply help inform a step in the process).



Management of Change Workflow

Caveat: You will see in the notes tab there are a few areas under development however I have given samples of data and logic to enable to estimation.  

Very important to note: these are very specific mostly based around a tool we had in place, tell the team to be create to explore our fundamental requirement of ease of use for our frontline staff.","The key is connecting to their SQL Server, they've never allowed internal or external systems to connect directly.

Process Manager will be the go forward BPM tool, they do need some context around the value proposition for Process Manager and why it can benefit vs holocentric or Iserver from a customer experience standpoint. 

We have agreed to present Employee onboarding to showcase the full breathe of the platform. Starting in Process Manager and running right through to automation / system integration. 

They want to know how Nintex can be used amongst a plethora of other tools essentially and how we can then work very hands on via CS and PS to help them roll this out successfully.

In addition to the market research above, David and Serdar are looking to assess how/if this can be ideally achieved with an 'off the shelf' solution or leveraging Microsoft power apps

Business Challenge: 
Struggle/Gap currently is that there is a requirement for the form to be prefilled by information both relative to the client as well as the care worker completing the form eg. If a care worker is onsite seeing a patient/client then the solution should look to prefill this information that is relative and critical to both parties 

Additionally, the above needs to be accessed and responsive on a mobile device with the ability to both capture images/photos as well as sketches that may be performed by the care worker (eg. Incident involving someone falling out of a wheelchair, it can be captured and attached to the incident/workflow) 

App specifically for this doesn't need to be created however the mobile responsiveness needs to be there for both execution and adoption experience","I've attached the Incident Report form that CatholicCare are looking at automating as a primary use case if that helps in forming a demonstration

Has direct access to all their databases and is capable of building any integrations himself.

Some use cases he described:

Client rings up to ask for some gardening to be done. And the moment it comes in and the gardening request comes into the customer service offices, they then have to go and try and find a gardner who's available. And then they would speak to the CS to I would leave it with the, so the rostering team to be able to try and figure out a time when they're available. If and then there's a whole bunch of conditions, if that's not available, then they would try and reorganize someone else's roster to be able to make the available. Otherwise they might go back to… the stuff the client and suggest alternate times and et cetera. So, so the request that comes external request comes in and gets bounced around between basically three or four key groups within here based on conditions of whether you're they are able to complete it or not. And then ultimately, you send some kind of communication back to the client and fill the shift in our rostering system and send a notification out to the team member.

•	Authoring environment for business folks to create document templates and versioning of loan contracts
•	Perhaps a simple workflow to demo the review and approval of document draft changes by internal staff
•	API capabilities (generating a document via an API call).
o	This is an important point for us because in our new architecture we are less reliant on a CRM like salesforce so having the ability resolve the data ahead of time and deliver them to the document generation engine would be great
•	Document storage and retrieval (for scenarios where customers request to have a copy sent to them at later time)
•	Bonus: e-sign by end user

A lot of processes are manual and paper heavy.
Eduardo saw Process Manager at Launceston but then Nintex Workflow Automation was discussed in an internal meeting. He said they are looking for some low hanging fruit and thinks automating some processes with external facing forms could achieve that. 
Step one is to have a Nintex Overview/General WF demo/Disco call with their team to educate them on what Nintex is and what we can do. Eduardo sent me some form examples and its definitely our bread and butter. 
The main one if their Notice of Intention form. I have attached below. 

I get the sense that the contact we will be talking with won't be that automation savvy so we will need to educate and hold their hand a bit. He said the reason that this type of project hadn't gotten off the ground before was due to lack of resources and ability.

",FALSE,FALSE,"As discussed we have now identified a process for a proof of concept.  

Attached is a workflow of the New Supplier Onboarding process, the supplier form and screen shots of the digital form used internally.

A summary of the steps for a new supplier is as follows:
1.	DV staff member emails form (ref F06.2a - Supplier Masterfile Data Form - New Supplier.pdf to the supplier)
2.	Supplier completes form and emails to DV staff
3.	DV staff initiates an internal digital form (ref K06.1 Supplier Creation or Update Request - Digital Form.png) checks for completeness, accuracy and authorisation and submits. 
Despite initiator ticking the box for having checked details for accuracy, details like entity name are not always correct and the form is returned to be sent to the supplier.

Note:  Workflow logic is built into the form that then routes the digital form to various staff/groups responsible for validating, setting up, approving and activating the supplier in our finance system, TechnologyOne.

4.	Various members from our internal Finance and Audit Control team members will create the supplier record, validate via ABN/ASIC/Google search checks and perform a verbal confirmation with the supplier of details.  Approval in the digital form moves it to the next step in the process.
5.	Checks and approval by the Group Head
6.	Final check, approval and supplier activation by the Financial Accountant Supplier the finance system

The reason the pdf form is emailed to the supplier is because our digital form is within our Microsoft 365 tenancy and we don’t allow any guest access.

",TRUE,TRUE,"NUP MIgration opp - Faizal has seen demo of NWC in the past, however, new management has come in and the person that I initially pitched NUP deal to orgiginally 2 months ago to has also left. Faizal has sent 3 processes they automate at th moment, and would like to see a demo of these in NWC. I think we can pick one of the following, though the one that uses the most of our tools. Please see below;

1)Maas Hardware Orders

Systems Used – Excel, Outlook

•	Read outlook email to check if we received a Rollout Form(which is an excel)
•	If received, then place the rollout form in the file folder.
•	Then validate the excel sheet if there are any duplicates, any missing information in the columns.
•	Then the BOT needs to create various order forms(which is excel again) using a order template(excel) and the Rollout form(form) by using the filtering on couple of couples.
•	Once created, we have to send these individual order forms to a team for them to approve or reject
•	If they approve, they send back the Dispatch notification to the robot mailbox
•	The bot which runs every 30mins check if there are any dispatch notifications and then grabs few details from the attachment and add back to the Rolloutform.
•	And then forward the dispatch notification to individual emails  
•	And at the end of process if then again looks if there anymore particular column which are empty, it checks if the activation date has been breached,  if breached it sends an email notification

2)Siebel Number Transfer 

Systems Involved – Siebel UI(CRM), Outlook, API

This process is a number transfer process from postpay to postpay or prepay to postpay in our Siebel CRM system, all the actions are mostly done via using CRM UI, apis and executes query from the Siebel DB.
Some high level steps,

•	Validates if the msisdn and account are under the same for example calling a DB query 
•	Disconnects the connection on the Siebel UI
•	Creates an post2pre order on the Siebel UI
•	Supresses notification using and api
•	Sends an email notification

3)BAT

Systems Used – WINSCP, ZIP file, Run macros, Excel, Outlook, Zafira UI


•	Downloads the sample accounts list from WINSCP and then runs a process on a Zafira tool which send an email to the robot mailbox
•	Extracts the report ID and downloads the list of csvs and pdfs from the WINSCP desktop application.
•	Unzips the folder
•	Executes the macro
•	Send the list of successful, failed list to the finance team","That migrating (which they seem happy to have done by us) will not lose any of their current capability, and in fact enhance what they are doing.",Included in Description above,TRUE,TRUE,Remote,FALSE,https://nintex.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/0062v00001XJHptAAH/view,TRUE,John Forsdick,FALSE,Item,sites/sales/apac/Lists/Technical Win Requests

4. Process Analysis 
- deeper dive into Systems, Lean (tags), Process Cost, Identification of inefficient/ineffective (non value add) steps.
- wait (lead) time versus active time (effort)

5. Change Management Benefits
- benefits of System in process to identify all process steps undertaken in ERP for example.  (impacts of system change)

5. Training
- how we use Promapp to create and deliver Training Modules, as an important feature of enablement
- how we track use  of training modules by User.

6. Risk Management
- how Promapp provides tangible control over organisational risks.
- how to identify a Process control as related to a known Organisational Obligation (Obligation – Risk – Control IP)
- Risk Owner role, approval flows

7. Automation

o	Replacing core systems
o	Journey mapping 
o	Customer data 
o	Legacy system swap out
o	Legacy process review 
o	Documenting processes (currently have Holocentric)

Drove value of BPM in pipeline of automation work and asked for more specific requirements: 

As discussed, here are some common major pain-points experienced by Finance and OTI together, as follows:

1)	Match off the SAP invoices to the Manual invoices. Reconcile the payments.
2)	Find the correct or current customer contact person who is responsible approve the PO or invoice. (Email and phone no)
3)	Credit or invoice write off agreed by sales but not processed in SAP. Therefore, invoices still showing outstanding
4)	Some invoices were not correctly uploaded in the Invoice portal that customer required.
5)	Example: AUpost and Startrack invoices they were entered under same customer no. Invoices need to be manual sent by OTI to different email address and quote different PO no.
6)	Sometimes the correct PO no was not indicated on the invoice, therefore invoice got rejected.
7)	Legal issues caused by the customer paid via 3rd party or interbank causing potential money laundering concern.
8)	Different plant no (SAP auto split line items)
9)	Different routing no ( SAP auto split line items )
10)	Different service contract no attached to sales order ( SAP auto split line items)

Whereas, customer issue One PO, some of customer are prefer one invoice to match one PO.  For the customer, it is confusing if we issue multiple invoices for their PO. Therefore, for the convenience or contract requirement of the customer, we manually invoice as per milestones. I have attached some process flowcharts that can help you better understand how some core activities occur within the business related to AR and sale of service maintenance contracts.

1.	Creating a process
a.	Process Name
b.	Introduction: This section may include background information, describe the purpose of the process, and explain the process scope. A scope statement can include both what is and is not included in a process. You may also choose to include an applicability matrix for a quick, visual guide to the process scope and roles involved.
c.	Process Inputs: Identify what input or need triggers the start of the process.
d.	Process Boundaries: Define clear parameters for where a process begins and ends.
e.	Process Flow: Use a flowchart or list all of the tasks involved in a process and their organization. Providing a visual illustration of the steps in a process can help readers quickly understand how it flows from start to finish.
f.	Process Outputs: This may be an actual product or less tangible result, but all processes have a purpose that they are designed to achieve. An output may actually be outside of the defined boundaries of a process, but knowing the expected outcome is relevant to understanding a process.
g.	Exceptions: Outline the exception management process, which is how exceptions to the normal process flow will be handled when they arise.
h.	Roles and Responsibilities: Multiple people may be responsible for carrying out different aspects of a business process. Include a list all of the roles and their associated responsibilities so that it’s clear who to contact when a problem occurs or a change needs to be implemented. Some process documents include a decision matrix to illustrate who can make decisions about different elements of a process.
i.	Process Approval: Outline procedures for reviewing, revising, and approving process documents.
2.	Variant Flow – Copy existing and set up variant for Chinese Language
3.	Explain Roles and Responsibilities in Promapp
4.	Cycle Costing – explain how Longson can use this tool to validate cycle cost of As-Is Processes against To-Be processes
5.	Explain the dashboard and how Leaders and IT can utilize this and how end users can use this to communicate details about the process to process responsible

Using Hollocentric for QMS and BPM and it isn't working - in particular as the team who built this up have almost all left.  Team engagement is really poor with Hollocentric.  Key stakeholder is mapping out current state big picture next week.  We are taking her through a managed trial / demo to help support this after they workshop big data flows. Also using CIRAM - by Bay Tech which is about to be shelfed so they need to migrate ASAP to a BPM and compliance tool. 


A couple of business cases for Automation:
1. Investigators out on site recording multi-media evidence and then collating into a system.  This isn't being recorded well and they need factual data like when / time it was recorded to use in court for prosecution. 
2. App created in Power Automate:  Helps teams work out the best way to get to different site locations in a  day...


Client detailed: Attached is the presentation about the spatial app.  No worries if that is not our sort of thing.  Of much more interest is the evidence gathering, the investigation process (turning that evidence into a brief which seems to me to be a very clearand strict process but which we have a belief that we need very specialised software for) replacing Holocentric, and bringing our processes to life.  The main contender if you want to have a look at it is Comtrac (because they specialise in legal investigation process and have a very strong sense of access control and security) and Pega (because it is in the department).  

I will send you the information about those things as soon as possible. This is a really interesting bunch of work and it sounds like our timing will be perfect.

Can you remind me what police you said you had worked with?  Our legal/investigation team (mostly ex crown solicitors and cops) a very top priority here and they are very compromised by our current systems.  They arent very technical and they feel very much not properly understood so if I could tell them that Nintex has worked successfully wiht a police organisation that would buy us a huge amount of confidence. 

The key problem is that they gather evidence and there is a delay while it sits in various places (mostly on carry around hard drives) until they can get itno the office to transfer it to Sharepoint.  The 2 major complications are that the guys are often in the field and working on their mobile hotspot or no internet connection at all until they get back to the office, and secondly they are often working with very large files (the other day they had a 14GB video file).",Promapp as a live repository of process / continuous improvement and meeting compliance requirements to replace https://www.baytech.com.au/ciram as they are stopping development.,"They'll use Promapp to help refine this over time.

Scenario #1: Currently Cassie is on a certain level and position, for example an admin, at a band 4. Just got a new job opp, placement will change to legal officer at band 6

The first worksheet in the attached file lists the function and non-functional requirements identified by the Western Power business and ICT stakeholders.  The second worksheet lists the scenarios that the business and ICT stakeholders would like to see in a demo.  

I would appreciate your feedback on the attached:
•	Can you nominate a third vendor?  Note that I've left Power Automate in, even though its probably not fit for purpose, just to address the ""can we roll your own solution from capabilities within Azure?"" discussion.  
•	Do the business and ICT criteria make sense to you?  We can finesse the wording if required, but this is largely using language that the business and ICT stakeholders understand.  If you think there are other criteria that should be included, happy to take that on board, as long as we address the Western Power criteria.  
•	Can you do a first pass review of the criteria and do your own self-assessment?  If you want to qualify the answer with additional information, can you just add it in as notes against each cell for the moment?",Demo and Tech requirements in the attached,Not initially,FALSE,FALSE,Remote,FALSE,Not opp yet,FALSE,Raffaele MalvasoMalvaso,FALSE,Item,sites/sales/apac/Lists/Technical Win Requests

Key problems she wants to solve: Current processes are static in pdf and become obsolete instantly. Lack of interaction with them.
Risk and Compliance management is also of interest as they have strong compliance requirments as they work with children and they stand to lose a lot of money through fines for not following guidelines.
She also asked about using Promapp as an incident reporting tool for this as well. The current protocol for this is a pdf form that gets printed off, scanned and sent by email. Chatted to her about NWC then and we agreed that they could use that for automation of a lot more processes as well.

So this is now a Promapp/NWC combined deal. She is very keen on Promapp and Nintex in general and thinks this would be a great opportunity to impress the management team and get it all there as they are currently in a state of growth and digitisation.

They are currently looking at solution called One Place for the incident reporting function and she also mentioned a solution called Story Park for communication between the organisation and parents. It's likely that we could most of this if not all.

•	User creates a document that has a process and approvals, assigns tasks to users to perform actions
•	Each template has rules, that are managed by the administrative/document management team (for example..
a.	Set this document to run a business process workflow and assign tasks if x = x etc.. (if Budget greater than $5m then send approval to CIO)
If helpful, here are our financial approval levels:
i.	Anything up to $100,000.00 – Director (Band 1) can approve.
ii.	$100K to $250K – Executive Director (Band 2) can approve.
iii.	$250K to $1M – Deputy Secretary (Band 3) can approve.
iv.	Over $1M – Secretary (Band 4) can approve.
b.	Set this document so that users can add signature and sign
c.	Send alerts to users when tasks/actions assigned to them or that are overdue outstanding
•	All approvals are stored in a central location for users to gain visibility (It would be great to understand the security model for the documents and approvals, as some approvals are more sensitive than other (ie hiring a contractor and their hourly rates)
•	Users can see a my dashboard that has everything outstanding for them to do/complete/action (inc history)
•	Users can work via outlook for approvals (assuming user maintains signature in a location on their profile)
•	If I document moves through workflow the versions are tracked.

Nigel (Capital Systems Lead) really likes Nintex in general and understands its capabilities. Really keen to use in whatever way he can. Whether it be for general workflows or the above project.

He sent me a Project Proposal form and workflow and is also going to send me something else in the next week to see what Nintex could do with it.

The scope is still wide, but he's keen to use it.

What we would really like to see is how a process (i.e. https://demo.promapp.com/a08b4ae6e03845a2bcaad918ae251399/Process/Minimode/Permalink/FA6z9SsAtqwbTsFy6S1uUC) is enacted through the workflow.

This would show us:
1.	The process map and activities / tasks.
2.	How it is ‘enacted’ by an end user (i.e. a checklist or workflow type system).
3.	How it uses online forms (I’ve alluded to a couple of forms in the tasks) and how this data is saved.
4.	What the reports /dashboards / statistics show about this process – i.e. a manager wants to ensure the medication is being managed effectively. (i.e. cycle time, compliance activities etc)

Hope that clears things up?

Thanks,
Mark.

Mostly the main capex form is completed by the business unit GM or HOD and they might delegate someone to complete the 3 quotes.

Now that we’ve got a whole other business (Transport Group) on board they use a completely different form and different system (D365) for order numbers etc etc. It appears that they’re completed by whoever is instigating the capex. There doesn’t appear to be a requirement to obtain 3 quotes, although I’m told that this is very much a requirement from Sime Darby HQ. They also have a couple of pages with set prices on IT & office related purchases. I’m told that this is because a preferred supplier is already in place.

They are keen to explore RPA and/or other relevant automation technology to streamline manual processes related to Financial Services Provider (FSP) registrations and de-registrations.  They have provided a Promapp mini mode link below and the attached supporting documentation:

3.1.2 FSP Registrar Initiated Deregistration

They are keen to see a demonstration of how RPA and/or workflow, etc, could be used to automate the manual elements of the process and provided some initial context below:

There are a range of deregistration reasons with the FSP Register, each with their own checking requirements, all of which are captured in this one process as it was logical to do that, but which makes for a somewhat messy process.   Also note some of these process steps are still draft as we bed in the new register and manual systems.

I suggest perhaps step 1.3 is a relatively straightforward one in terms of the register checks that need to be made before deregistration is initiated in step 3.0 (attached guide relates to this step).  We can provide additional screen shots if useful.

I’m keen to engage with the relevant Nintex pre-sales technical resource to build out a custom demonstration, and I’d suggest in the first instance we jump on a call to discuss requirements and scope in more detail.  This is one of a large number of similar processes so the overall opportunity potential is significant.  Furthermore, we can use this as a ‘foot in the door’ to drive automation across the other MBIE tenants.

Hi Tony,
 
A sample standard Exhibitor Manual would look similar to the attached.
 
Not just Moreton Hire forms, but forms for other suppliers that would be attached, along with a CAD drawing. Only forms that require input to us have been attached, the other documents (not attached) would ideally be displayed or available to download by the exhibitor.
Also attached is a sample list of exhibitors that would be the list of people that would need to complete the form.
 
1)	Venue – information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered
2)	Freight Forwarder - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered, exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
3)	Rigging - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered, exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
4)	Registration / Lead Capture Device – This forms Attachements ¾ are attached and is what MH requires. In the current ProConnect this form has been broken down into various forms that are turned on/off as required
5)	Accommodation - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered
6)	Cleaning - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered, exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
7)	Plumbing for applicable shows - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered, exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
8)	Council Permits (e.g. Food Handling for food shows) , exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
9)	Moreton Hire Forms – any other show specific forms – some are fyi only
10)	Refrigeration – optional for food shows
 
Happy to discuss if you need clarification.
 
Also, here are some screenshots from the current ProConnect. If useful, I can provide a login for you.

PAIN: Have a dozen or so processes that require to be automated. Forms based processes like an enquiry transition into an actual quote and then transition to an actual project- that each require steps of approval or additional info- links- info to forms- workflow moving that in org to diff departments to add their part to it or perform an action. 
Basically a home automation company- customer has made an enquiry about automating their home- they take customer details- fill form- what their interest is what products they require- build a quote- get it reviewed internally send to customer- then goes back and forth until theres agreement or loss of sale. If they accept it would move to a new process will go to accounting will build for deposit and back to sales or design team to work with plans and get wiring schedules etc then go procurement who will procure the product will send an email to either contractor or electrician will follow instructions given within process- either form letter or actual instructions- then comes back to them and goes to build teams – then back to accounting then back to delivering product to house. Handover and then q and a at end 

Theres several processes that go to these types of projects. 

Currently - was manual but have built one or two processes into kissflow but he said it was fast but a lot of inconsistencies and down time and doesn’t behave consistently and rigid cant change look and feel and support is non existent only in late afternoon.

Authrity; primary contact. Owner of company has already given the ok to him. Our user model is very attractive has gone this path with kissflow need to present poc to show Nintex is better – went live last week and now its showing issues 

Openness to change; right now need to do a poc as they already committed – kissflow haven’t bough a yearly and rolling it monthly. Need to build poc first show its viable and more stable and then will get more info about support and when people are available to support it.

They are using Flow and Power automate but have realised it is not as easy to rebuild as once thought. Have 600 on prem workflows with Nintex and are strong Promapp users too so are keen to see what with Nintex in the cloud. Auswide were initially quoted for 600 wfs and as a result were put off by the cost. I have positioned licensing based off their headcount so Nintex is within their budget and is seemingly an easier path to go down for this migration.

However, I have been provided a list of questions to answer on my next call and need help on some of them:

•	At renewal, what are our options?
o	Costs with taking on cloud based Nintex?
	Upfront and ongoing?
o	Can we stick to only the on prem option at renewal? If yes, expected costs?
o	If we do not have Office 365 including cloud based Sharepoint, will this impact cloud based Nintex?
o	Can we get access to a trial version of Nintex cloud to review for migration shortcomings?
•	Differences between Nintex Cloud and the on prem solution?
o	Responsive forms vs classic forms
	Many of our key solutions have over 200-300 fields. In my experience, responsive forms do not allow fields to be tightly formatted on a form? Is there any way to overcome this?
	Occasionally, with some of our more complex solutions we use JS to toggle Boolean values or repeater sizes depending on the value of other controls. Can this still be done?
	Any other differences between the forms? Perhaps based on feedback from other clients?
o	Any functions that are known to have been removed (workflows)?
o	Is the cloud server multi-tenant?
o	Where is the cloud server based? Is there any contingency in the event a data centre goes offline? If yes, where is the contingent data centre?  
•	Support for old on prem solution?
o	You mentioned that, if we were to go for the cloud based solution, we would retain our on prem solution indefinitely. Is there any limitation to this?
o	Will nintex still support on prem solution based enquiries?

•	ThreeBy3 have a product which is a survey tool that captures answers to questions and then spits out a rating across key areas of the customers business and where they need to focus their marketing efforts.
•	The current system is built on Drupal and it is slow and clunky. 

Current Solution

•	I have attached a visual walkthrough of the forms with this email for you. 

End Solution

•	We are investigating replacing this with a Nintex Forms and Workflow solution.
•	Nintex Forms to capture the survey data and add to SQL Server, and then Nintex Workflow to generate a document, and then Nintex Workflow to assign tasks to the end user to focus on certain areas and action items and monitor their progress.
•	What we need in the end solution:
o	Look great
o	Fast and easy to use
o	Work seamlessly across mobile, tablet and desktop
o	Allow users to sign up via Nintex Forms and then add that user into Azure Active Directory (or similar) so that we can get them to login
o	Capture the survey data into a central SQL database
o	Use Nintex Workflow to generate the document 
o	Use Nintex Workflow to assign one or more tasks to the end user to focus on a specific area of their marketing efforts 
o	Eventually integrate with Stripe (or similar) to take payment from the user

Teaser Demo

Working through a migration to cloud strategy and want to understand how these solutions already built out in Nintex can be replicated, whilst using the added functionality of Nintex cloud to automate complex processes.

They are assessing Microsoft Flow/Power apps

Finance and invoicing called out as a key process needing continual automation as they have 150-200 submissions a day for invoicing. 

Current usage example:

The solution components include a SharePoint list containing the form items (saved and submitted forms), a number of lookup lists (eg. Country, Currency), a Nintex Form, 8 separate Nintex Workflows with 4 Flexi Tasks, custom Site Pages for the various groups to access their tasks and view “in progress” forms, and integration with Active Directory and our SAP Finance system.

Some key functionality to call out would be:
•	Multiple approvers on a flexi task (where “all must agree”)
•	Attachments on tasks
•	API calls from forms using custom javascript (within the main form and flexi task forms)
•	We have a site workflow which runs each night and will send out reminders to people who have overdue tasks. If tasks are not actioned within a specified time, another workflow will send out a cancelled notification, terminate the workflow and archive the form.
•	Task delegation – we often need to delegate an approval task to a different user (eg. if the original approver is unexpectedly away)

As an example of their use of Nintex Forms and Workflows, I’ve attached some original requirement documentation for one of our critical (and probably most complex) business processes, Invoice Payments.  Attached is:

•	The business process: Request Payment Processes v1.5.pdf
•	Use Case Requirements document which describes how the form itself works: UC1.11_Payment_Request_v1.3.pdf

They make extensive use of SharePoint online, and have E5 O365 licensing across the org.  as such they are making use of Power Automate in some areas.

They like a lot of the functionality that SharePoint offers, but dislike the user interface and other issues.  Forms to simplify user interaction with lists and libraries would be of benefit.  They are also interested in mobile forms for their contractors.

They also use OutSystems and Daryl is keen to understand where we overlap and what extra value we add. 

The standard universal demo would be great, with a focus on where we differ from the 'Power Platform'.

Daryl asked for the demo on Thursday 1st at 3.30pm so he can get the right audiance.

Go Car Finance is an auto lending company and the most trusted in NZ! This is because we provide wrap-around support to our clients and work hard to not only get them into their vehicle but also help them to keep and maintain it as well. Therefore on top of vehicle finance, we offer a range of packages such as maintenance (WOF & Rego), claims for vehicle repairs and insurance packages clients can opt into at the beginning of their loan. As we grow and expand, so do our projects and we have a few new projects in the pipeline that we want to launch using low code. However, as these projects are large and costly, we want to ensure we can navigate and harness low code first by trialling this in our smaller existing processes first. \n\nI have attached a process map for our Health Waiver. This is a product a client can opt into at the beginning of their loan and claim upon if they become ill or hospitalised. If the client has the health waiver, we can subsidise their payments until they get back up on their feet. However, as you can tell by looking at this process map, the process is manually done with the use of finpower (our loan management system) and there are not many touch points along the way with the client. \nIt would be fantastic to see what this process, as is, could look like in Ninetex while discussing our requirements and Ninetex capabilities. \n\ni met with them today to further qualify - their GM Jeff Gormley is the project sponsor, he was on the call and will attend the demo. \n\nThey utlimaely want to automate their entire end to end lending platform, but are starting small to evaluate the approach.\n\nAbsolute preference for low code, no code.  approx 70 employees, business growing fast but don't want to have to keep adding more people.
