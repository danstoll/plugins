Looking to understand both Process Manager & Automation (focus on automation however).

Opp brought to us by a partner with champion at Wyvern being the IT Consultant. 

Focus on two use cases ideally to showcase (realise that we may not have time to tailor it so our basic onboarding demo would be great as they need to onboard 200+ employees). 

1st - What about employee onboarding with something along the lines of:
-send IT tasks to IT Manager, automatically add user to the Azure tenancy and group
-Send HR tasks to HR manager
-Send a contract for signature

Procurement Pathway Tool

The outcome of the workflow (regardless of which option we end up with) is to provide end users with 1 of 3 pathways (ie sub-processes in Promapp) they are required to follow.  

The options are both  based on the corporate risk matrix, just in different ways – one with a set of questions (option 1) and the other being a visual representation that they select from (option 2).  

Option 1 (this is the option we briefly talked through last week):
•	A set of 5 multi choice questions to select the ‘worst case’ of something happening, one for each of the corporate risk matrix categories (with 5 answers to choose from – representative of the 5 risk levels) and 
•	An accompanying likelihood multi choice question (5 answers to choose from)
•	The combination of answers are mapped in the background to 1 of the 3 pathways/sub-processes they need to then follow in Promapp, and the user is advised of that outcome.  

Option 2:
A visual representation of the corporate risk matrix
The user clicks on/selects the most relevant option from each of the categories in the risk matrix
Once they select a box (say for the health & safety column in the risk matrix) they would then be asked to assign the likelihood to that risk (maybe a pop up box or similar to select the likelihood).

Option 3:
Our friends at Nintex choice!  If there is a more user friendly way to get the user to the outcome based on the logic, we’d love to hear it!

I’ve attached the list of questions (word file) and an excel file containing the mapping of the combined answers (ignore columns M onwards for now) to inform the outcome of the workflow.  You’ll note question 1 does not have a corresponding ‘likelihood’ question associated with it, and therefore this is mapped directly into the pathways/outcomes table as A, B, C, D or E.  There is also a question 6, which does not require mapping (it will simply help inform a step in the process).



Management of Change Workflow

Caveat: You will see in the notes tab there are a few areas under development however I have given samples of data and logic to enable to estimation.

This is a fast deployment with an end of June the cut off date to have everything live and fully functioning. They are interested in having a managed trial and also in getting pricing for professional services.

They expect to run about 5,000 of these a year but have other projects they will look to deploy this solution into as well.

When an architect wants to schedule a review of their work, their current process is extremely manual:
If they have already had their work reviewed by more than two authorised people, it is approved. If they haven’t had it reviewed by anyone, it is automatically rejected. If they have had it reviewed by 1-2 people, they need to organise a review meeting as below
They have to contact the coordinator (Helen) to book a review slot. These are pre-scheduled slots on Mondays and Tuesdays and Helen picks the first available slot
She sends the documentation and the calendar invite out to everyone who needs to be in the review. Documentation is usually stored in Confluence and sometimes in R-doc but sending a link is fine rather than sending the actual documents
She updates Jira to say the documentation is under review

Maybe create a SP list as a substitute Jira to show how that would work.
If >2 people have reviewed, then set the Jira status to approved and stop the workflow. If no-one has reviewed then reject the meeting request with a reason
If 1-2 people have reviewed then find the next Mon/Tue free slot and book it via Exchange. The calendar invite should contain a link to confluence and the summary of the project. For the purposes of the demo the scheduled slots are Mon 12-1pm and Tue 12-1pm.

Struggle/Gap currently is that there is a requirement for the form to be prefilled by information both relative to the client as well as the care worker completing the form eg.

Has direct access to all their databases and is capable of building any integrations himself.

Some use cases he described:

Client rings up to ask for some gardening to be done. And the moment it comes in and the gardening request comes into the customer service offices, they then have to go and try and find a gardner who's available. And then they would speak to the CS to I would leave it with the, so the rostering team to be able to try and figure out a time when they're available. If and then there's a whole bunch of conditions, if that's not available, then they would try and reorganize someone else's roster to be able to make the available. Otherwise they might go back to… the stuff the client and suggest alternate times and et cetera. So, so the request that comes external request comes in and gets bounced around between basically three or four key groups within here based on conditions of whether you're they are able to complete it or not. And then ultimately, you send some kind of communication back to the client and fill the shift in our rostering system and send a notification out to the team member.

All of their internal forms are still heavily manual and paper-based and there is a lot of low hanging fruit for automation and efficiency gains. Mentioned that there is also an opportunity to automate some field services processes - mobile apps/forms

Mentioned employee onboarding/offboarding as a typical process that we automate and she said that is a key process that they need to automate as it is very manual. IT are always late to know about new employees starting and have to rush to get them set up with access etc.

They are also evaluating Prime BPM as a process mapping tool and Emma has used Promapp in a previous role as well but didnt realise Nintex now owned it. Keen to see the differences between that and Prime so I suggested we do the Employee Onboarding demo with process manager and workflow with use also showing the mobile apps studio for field services.","Process Manager & NAC - Employee Onboarding demo

•	Authoring environment for business folks to create document templates and versioning of loan contracts
•	Perhaps a simple workflow to demo the review and approval of document draft changes by internal staff
•	API capabilities (generating a document via an API call).
o	This is an important point for us because in our new architecture we are less reliant on a CRM like salesforce so having the ability resolve the data ahead of time and deliver them to the document generation engine would be great

Eduardo saw Process Manager at Launceston but then Nintex Workflow Automation was discussed in an internal meeting. He said they are looking for some low hanging fruit and thinks automating some processes with external facing forms could achieve that. 
Step one is to have a Nintex Overview/General WF demo/Disco call with their team to educate them on what Nintex is and what we can do. Eduardo sent me some form examples and its definitely our bread and butter. 
The main one if their Notice of Intention form. I have attached below. 

I get the sense that the contact we will be talking with won't be that automation savvy so we will need to educate and hold their hand a bit. He said the reason that this type of project hadn't gotten off the ground before was due to lack of resources and ability. Eduardo also said that there will be some new hires in the conversation as well. 

I also sent him some examples of external facing NAC forms and he liked them.

He also said that he will be getting some more details on what the processes behind these forms. I will get them and send them over. Potentially could be able to do a full demo if it's not complex a process.

Here is a link to other types of Forms:

Their key requirement is they want the ability to fill in an initial form to set up the tender.  The reviewers must have the ability to edit the fields on this form.  This lends more naturally to a K2 solution but we've agreed that we'll first demo what is possible in NWC using task forms first before considering K2.  NB editing the risk repeating section cannot be managed via the task form.

Current process:
If under a certain contract value, the form is completed in-house.  If it's over a certain value, it goes to external lawyers to complete (currently a word doc).


After that it goes to the GM of the State, then Head of Legal then if over $5M to the CEO.

Some information then does go to a contract approval memo which is electronically signed.
Contracts are then stored in email (and they should really be stored somewhere else).","Demo will show population of the original form

","Customer has used Process Manager in a past life, they are currently evaluating Process Street and Flowingly.

•	Ryan (Integration/Automation Developer), Michael Macfarlane (IT Mgr) and Tina(BA) are currently reviewing processes at North Sydney Council 

•	Currently reviewing soluti
ons that will allow both process management and mapping as well as workflow automation 
•	Review is currently underway without any specific project but with a focus on: 

o	Improving the overall process capturing that is currently being used today (visio, word doc, etc) 
o	Single-sign on requirement for the solution 
o	Standardising the overall format of processes in the business for two ultimate reasons;
	Empowering end users to document their own processes 
	Improve upon these processes either through continuous improvement and/or automating the more manual tasks that have been identified 

•	Previously used Promapp at Randwick Council but with more of a focus on the end user interface rather than the creation/management of processes behind the scenes 
•	Timeline currently is set for calendar year and ideally will sign off before 2023 arrives 
•	Initial pricing is around $50,000-60,000 AUD per year (excluding onboarding costs) for Promapp(Process mapping/management) 
•	We would need to dive deeper for the exact costs regarding workflow automation beyond the above but more than happy to walk through this with you when it suits

Next steps: 
•	Introduction to the wider team for a demonstration on the 22nd November, 9:30am 
o	Both Dean and Thomas Kholenbach(Presaes Promapp Engineer) are in town for a face/face meeting 
o	Presentation/demo of the overall solution with a focus on process management and workflow automation 
•	Possible stakeholder group for a POC could be Finance or HR 
•	Review commercial framework and technical documents (ICT, T&C's) etc and understand if this is the right fit for North Sydney Council

Attached is a workflow of the New Supplier Onboarding process, the supplier form and screen shots of the digital form used internally.

A summary of the steps for a new supplier is as follows:
1.	DV staff member emails form (ref F06.2a - Supplier Masterfile Data Form - New Supplier.pdf to the supplier)
2.	Supplier completes form and emails to DV staff
3.	DV staff initiates an internal digital form (ref K06.1 Supplier Creation or Update Request - Digital Form.png) checks for completeness, accuracy and authorisation and submits. 
Despite initiator ticking the box for having checked details for accuracy, details like entity name are not always correct and the form is returned to be sent to the supplier.

Note:  Workflow logic is built into the form that then routes the digital form to various staff/groups responsible for validating, setting up, approving and activating the supplier in our finance system, TechnologyOne.

4.	Various members from our internal Finance and Audit Control team members will create the supplier record, validate via ABN/ASIC/Google search checks and perform a verbal confirmation with the supplier of details.  Approval in the digital form moves it to the next step in the process.
5.	Checks and approval by the Group Head
6.	Final check, approval and supplier activation by the Financial Accountant Supplier the finance system

The reason the pdf form is emailed to the supplier is because our digital form is within our Microsoft 365 tenancy and we don’t allow any guest access.

Faizal has sent 3 processes they automate at th moment, and would like to see a demo of these in NWC. I think we can pick one of the following, though the one that uses the most of our tools. Please see below;

1)Maas Hardware Orders

Systems Used – Excel, Outlook

•	Read outlook email to check if we received a Rollout Form(which is an excel)
•	If received, then place the rollout form in the file folder.
•	Then validate the excel sheet if there are any duplicates, any missing information in the columns.
•	Then the BOT needs to create various order forms(which is excel again) using a order template(excel) and the Rollout form(form) by using the filtering on couple of couples.
•	Once created, we have to send these individual order forms to a team for them to approve or reject
•	If they approve, they send back the Dispatch notification to the robot mailbox
•	The bot which runs every 30mins check if there are any dispatch notifications and then grabs few details from the attachment and add back to the Rolloutform.
•	And then forward the dispatch notification to individual emails  
•	And at the end of process if then again looks if there anymore particular column which are empty, it checks if the activation date has been breached,  if breached it sends an email notification

2)Siebel Number Transfer 

Systems Involved – Siebel UI(CRM), Outlook, API

This process is a number transfer process from postpay to postpay or prepay to postpay in our Siebel CRM system, all the actions are mostly done via using CRM UI, apis and executes query from the Siebel DB.
Some high level steps,

•	Validates if the msisdn and account are under the same for example calling a DB query 
•	Disconnects the connection on the Siebel UI
•	Creates an post2pre order on the Siebel UI
•	Supresses notification using and api
•	Sends an email notification

3)BAT

Systems Used – WINSCP, ZIP file, Run macros, Excel, Outlook, Zafira UI


•	Downloads the sample accounts list from WINSCP and then runs a process on a Zafira tool which send an email to the robot mailbox
•	Extracts the report ID and downloads the list of csvs and pdfs from the WINSCP desktop application.
•	Unzips the folder
•	Executes the macro
•	Send the list of successful, failed list to the finance team","That migrating (which they seem happy to have done by us) will not lose any of their current capability, and in fact enhance what they are doing.",Included in Description above,TRUE,TRUE,Remote,FALSE,TRUE,John Forsdick,FALSE

2.	Based on which boxes are ticked by the Buyer – mandatory approvals/attachments.
3.	Approvals by Exec Director of Terms&Conditions + Expenditure by Value Centre Manager to be done more systematically than by outlook email.
4.	Info from the web form ideally copied across into Microsoft Dynamics Great Plains when needed (this less important if it causes headaches + note it is Microsoft Dynamics GP not dynamics 365).

2)	Find the correct or current customer contact person who is responsible approve the PO or invoice. (Email and phone no)
3)	Credit or invoice write off agreed by sales but not processed in SAP. Therefore, invoices still showing outstanding
4)	Some invoices were not correctly uploaded in the Invoice portal that customer required.
5)	Example: AUpost and Startrack invoices they were entered under same customer no. Invoices need to be manual sent by OTI to different email address and quote different PO no.
6)	Sometimes the correct PO no was not indicated on the invoice, therefore invoice got rejected.
7)	Legal issues caused by the customer paid via 3rd party or interbank causing potential money laundering concern.
8)	Different plant no (SAP auto split line items)
9)	Different routing no ( SAP auto split line items )
10)	Different service contract no attached to sales order ( SAP auto split line items)

Whereas, customer issue One PO, some of customer are prefer one invoice to match one PO.  For the customer, it is confusing if we issue multiple invoices for their PO. Therefore, for the convenience or contract requirement of the customer, we manually invoice as per milestones.

a.	Process Name
b.	Introduction: This section may include background information, describe the purpose of the process, and explain the process scope. A scope statement can include both what is and is not included in a process. You may also choose to include an applicability matrix for a quick, visual guide to the process scope and roles involved.
c.	Process Inputs: Identify what input or need triggers the start of the process.
d.	Process Boundaries: Define clear parameters for where a process begins and ends.
e.	Process Flow: Use a flowchart or list all of the tasks involved in a process and their organization. Providing a visual illustration of the steps in a process can help readers quickly understand how it flows from start to finish.
f.	Process Outputs: This may be an actual product or less tangible result, but all processes have a purpose that they are designed to achieve. An output may actually be outside of the defined boundaries of a process, but knowing the expected outcome is relevant to understanding a process.
g.	Exceptions: Outline the exception management process, which is how exceptions to the normal process flow will be handled when they arise.
h.	Roles and Responsibilities: Multiple people may be responsible for carrying out different aspects of a business process. Include a list all of the roles and their associated responsibilities so that it’s clear who to contact when a problem occurs or a change needs to be implemented. Some process documents include a decision matrix to illustrate who can make decisions about different elements of a process.
i.	Process Approval: Outline procedures for reviewing, revising, and approving process documents.
2.	Variant Flow – Copy existing and set up variant for Chinese Language
3.	Explain Roles and Responsibilities in Promapp
4.	Cycle Costing – explain how Longson can use this tool to validate cycle cost of As-Is Processes against To-Be processes
5.	Explain the dashboard and how Leaders and IT can utilize this and how end users can use this to communicate details about the process to process responsible

A couple of business cases for Automation:
1. Investigators out on site recording multi-media evidence and then collating into a system.  This isn't being recorded well and they need factual data like when / time it was recorded to use in court for prosecution. 
2. App created in Power Automate:  Helps teams work out the best way to get to different site locations in a  day...


Client detailed: Attached is the presentation about the spatial app.  No worries if that is not our sort of thing.

The main contender if you want to have a look at it is Comtrac (because they specialise in legal investigation process and have a very strong sense of access control and security) and Pega (because it is in the department).  

I will send you the information about those things as soon as possible. This is a really interesting bunch of work and it sounds like our timing will be perfect.

Our legal/investigation team (mostly ex crown solicitors and cops) a very top priority here and they are very compromised by our current systems.  They arent very technical and they feel very much not properly understood so if I could tell them that Nintex has worked successfully wiht a police organisation that would buy us a huge amount of confidence. 

The key problem is that they gather evidence and there is a delay while it sits in various places (mostly on carry around hard drives) until they can get itno the office to transfer it to Sharepoint.

In order to continue to map all their processes down to level 2,1,0 out in these tools and then to maintain them, it will take way too long.  Iqbal (main contact) has calculated that manually it will take them 1000 hours, with the correct BPM solution it will take them 450 hours. So it will save them time, and therefore cost

As they are under going some system changes and will eventually look to automate where appropriate, they also want the ability to map out as is and to be, as well as use it as a way to determine where automation is possible and then what level of automation tool is going to be necessary (Service now or potentially NWC down the line)

In order to get this in, they will potentially need a co-sponsor to really justify the implementation and the risk team came up as they are evaluating SN's GRC system and there is potential for us to do that too.

Key problems she wants to solve: Current processes are static in pdf and become obsolete instantly. Lack of interaction with them.
Risk and Compliance management is also of interest as they have strong compliance requirments as they work with children and they stand to lose a lot of money through fines for not following guidelines.
She also asked about using Promapp as an incident reporting tool for this as well. The current protocol for this is a pdf form that gets printed off, scanned and sent by email. Chatted to her about NWC then and we agreed that they could use that for automation of a lot more processes as well.

So this is now a Promapp/NWC combined deal. She is very keen on Promapp and Nintex in general and thinks this would be a great opportunity to impress the management team and get it all there as they are currently in a state of growth and digitisation.

They are currently looking at solution called One Place for the incident reporting function and she also mentioned a solution called Story Park for communication between the organisation and parents. It's likely that we could most of this if not all.

This would show us:
1.	The process map and activities / tasks.
2.	How it is ‘enacted’ by an end user (i.e. a checklist or workflow type system).
3.	How it uses online forms (I’ve alluded to a couple of forms in the tasks) and how this data is saved.
4.	What the reports /dashboards / statistics show about this process – i.e. a manager wants to ensure the medication is being managed effectively. (i.e. cycle time, compliance activities etc)

Hope that clears things up?

Thanks,
Mark.

There are a range of deregistration reasons with the FSP Register, each with their own checking requirements, all of which are captured in this one process as it was logical to do that, but which makes for a somewhat messy process.   Also note some of these process steps are still draft as we bed in the new register and manual systems.

I suggest perhaps step 1.3 is a relatively straightforward one in terms of the register checks that need to be made before deregistration is initiated in step 3.0 (attached guide relates to this step).  We can provide additional screen shots if useful.

I’m keen to engage with the relevant Nintex pre-sales technical resource to build out a custom demonstration, and I’d suggest in the first instance we jump on a call to discuss requirements and scope in more detail.  This is one of a large number of similar processes so the overall opportunity potential is significant.  Furthermore, we can use this as a ‘foot in the door’ to drive automation across the other MBIE tenants.  On a related note, I’m sure Thomas will have a heart attack when he’s sees the process map – I’m sure we could offer them support, etc, to help them use Promapp more effectively,

Hi Tony,
 
A sample standard Exhibitor Manual would look similar to the attached.
 
Not just Moreton Hire forms, but forms for other suppliers that would be attached, along with a CAD drawing. Only forms that require input to us have been attached, the other documents (not attached) would ideally be displayed or available to download by the exhibitor.
Also attached is a sample list of exhibitors that would be the list of people that would need to complete the form.
 
1)	Venue – information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered
2)	Freight Forwarder - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered, exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
3)	Rigging - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered, exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
4)	Registration / Lead Capture Device – This forms Attachements ¾ are attached and is what MH requires. In the current ProConnect this form has been broken down into various forms that are turned on/off as required
5)	Accommodation - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered
6)	Cleaning - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered, exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
7)	Plumbing for applicable shows - information sheet to be attached or linked, no input to be gathered, exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
8)	Council Permits (e.g. Food Handling for food shows) , exhibitor would submit directly to 3rd party supplier
9)	Moreton Hire Forms – any other show specific forms – some are fyi only
10)	Refrigeration – optional for food shows
 
Happy to discuss if you need clarification.
 
Also, here are some screenshots from the current ProConnect. If useful, I can provide a login for you.

Basically a home automation company- customer has made an enquiry about automating their home- they take customer details- fill form- what their interest is what products they require- build a quote- get it reviewed internally send to customer- then goes back and forth until theres agreement or loss of sale. If they accept it would move to a new process will go to accounting will build for deposit and back to sales or design team to work with plans and get wiring schedules etc then go procurement who will procure the product will send an email to either contractor or electrician will follow instructions given within process- either form letter or actual instructions- then comes back to them and goes to build teams – then back to accounting then back to delivering product to house.

o	Can we stick to only the on prem option at renewal? If yes, expected costs?
o	If we do not have Office 365 including cloud based Sharepoint, will this impact cloud based Nintex?
o	Can we get access to a trial version of Nintex cloud to review for migration shortcomings?
•	Differences between Nintex Cloud and the on prem solution?
o	Responsive forms vs classic forms
	Many of our key solutions have over 200-300 fields. In my experience, responsive forms do not allow fields to be tightly formatted on a form? Is there any way to overcome this?
	Occasionally, with some of our more complex solutions we use JS to toggle Boolean values or repeater sizes depending on the value of other controls. Can this still be done?
	Any other differences between the forms? Perhaps based on feedback from other clients?
o	Any functions that are known to have been removed (workflows)?
o	Is the cloud server multi-tenant?
o	Where is the cloud server based? Is there any contingency in the event a data centre goes offline? If yes, where is the contingent data centre?  
•	Support for old on prem solution?
o	You mentioned that, if we were to go for the cloud based solution, we would retain our on prem solution indefinitely. Is there any limitation to this?

•	ThreeBy3 have a product which is a survey tool that captures answers to questions and then spits out a rating across key areas of the customers business and where they need to focus their marketing efforts.
•	The current system is built on Drupal and it is slow and clunky. 

Current Solution

•	I have attached a visual walkthrough of the forms with this email for you. 

End Solution

•	We are investigating replacing this with a Nintex Forms and Workflow solution.
•	Nintex Forms to capture the survey data and add to SQL Server, and then Nintex Workflow to generate a document, and then Nintex Workflow to assign tasks to the end user to focus on certain areas and action items and monitor their progress.
•	What we need in the end solution:
o	Look great
o	Fast and easy to use
o	Work seamlessly across mobile, tablet and desktop
o	Allow users to sign up via Nintex Forms and then add that user into Azure Active Directory (or similar) so that we can get them to login
o	Capture the survey data into a central SQL database
o	Use Nintex Workflow to generate the document 
o	Use Nintex Workflow to assign one or more tasks to the end user to focus on a specific area of their marketing efforts 
o	Eventually integrate with Stripe (or similar) to take payment from the user

Teaser Demo

•	It would be great if we could build a few of the forms in clickable demo style and show the art of the possible and how we may be able to solve the above scenario. 
•	Of course early stages so I just need to show a teaser of the above and how we may be able to solve this scenario.

Working through a migration to cloud strategy and want to understand how these solutions already built out in Nintex can be replicated, whilst using the added functionality of Nintex cloud to automate complex processes.

They are assessing Microsoft Flow/Power apps

Finance and invoicing called out as a key process needing continual automation as they have 150-200 submissions a day for invoicing. 

Current usage example:

The solution components include a SharePoint list containing the form items (saved and submitted forms), a number of lookup lists (eg. Country, Currency), a Nintex Form, 8 separate Nintex Workflows with 4 Flexi Tasks, custom Site Pages for the various groups to access their tasks and view “in progress” forms, and integration with Active Directory and our SAP Finance system.

Some key functionality to call out would be:
•	Multiple approvers on a flexi task (where “all must agree”)
•	Attachments on tasks
•	API calls from forms using custom javascript (within the main form and flexi task forms)
•	We have a site workflow which runs each night and will send out reminders to people who have overdue tasks. If tasks are not actioned within a specified time, another workflow will send out a cancelled notification, terminate the workflow and archive the form.
•	Task delegation – we often need to delegate an approval task to a different user (eg. if the original approver is unexpectedly away)

As an example of their use of Nintex Forms and Workflows, I’ve attached some original requirement documentation for one of our critical (and probably most complex) business processes, Invoice Payments.  Attached is:

•	The business process: Request Payment Processes v1.5.pdf
•	Use Case Requirements document which describes how the form itself works: UC1.11_Payment_Request_v1.3.pdf

Go Car Finance is an auto lending company and the most trusted in NZ! This is because we provide wrap-around support to our clients and work hard to not only get them into their vehicle but also help them to keep and maintain it as well. Therefore on top of vehicle finance, we offer a range of packages such as maintenance (WOF & Rego), claims for vehicle repairs and insurance packages clients can opt into at the beginning of their loan. As we grow and expand, so do our projects and we have a few new projects in the pipeline that we want to launch using low code. However, as these projects are large and costly, we want to ensure we can navigate and harness low code first by trialling this in our smaller existing processes first. \n\nI have attached a process map for our Health Waiver. This is a product a client can opt into at the beginning of their loan and claim upon if they become ill or hospitalised. If the client has the health waiver, we can subsidise their payments until they get back up on their feet. However, as you can tell by looking at this process map, the process is manually done with the use of finpower (our loan management system) and there are not many touch points along the way with the client. \nIt would be fantastic to see what this process, as is, could look like in Ninetex while discussing our requirements and Ninetex capabilities. \n\ni met with them today to further qualify - their GM Jeff Gormley is the project sponsor, he was on the call and will attend the demo. \n\nThey utlimaely want to automate their entire end to end lending platform, but are starting small to evaluate the approach.\n\nAbsolute preference for low code, no code.  approx 70 employees, business growing fast but don't want to have to keep adding more people.
