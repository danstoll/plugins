Focus on two use cases ideally to showcase (realise that we may not have time to tailor it so our basic onboarding demo would be great as they need to onboard 200+ employees). 

1st - What about employee onboarding with something along the lines of:
-send IT tasks to IT Manager, automatically add user to the Azure tenancy and group
-Send HR tasks to HR manager
-Send a contract for signature

Procurement Pathway Tool

The outcome of the workflow (regardless of which option we end up with) is to provide end users with 1 of 3 pathways (ie sub-processes in Promapp) they are required to follow.  

The options are both  based on the corporate risk matrix, just in different ways – one with a set of questions (option 1) and the other being a visual representation that they select from (option 2).  

Option 1 (this is the option we briefly talked through last week):
•	A set of 5 multi choice questions to select the ‘worst case’ of something happening, one for each of the corporate risk matrix categories (with 5 answers to choose from – representative of the 5 risk levels) and 
•	An accompanying likelihood multi choice question (5 answers to choose from)
•	The combination of answers are mapped in the background to 1 of the 3 pathways/sub-processes they need to then follow in Promapp, and the user is advised of that outcome.  

Option 2:
A visual representation of the corporate risk matrix
The user clicks on/selects the most relevant option from each of the categories in the risk matrix
Once they select a box (say for the health & safety column in the risk matrix) they would then be asked to assign the likelihood to that risk (maybe a pop up box or similar to select the likelihood).

Option 3:
Our friends at Nintex choice!  If there is a more user friendly way to get the user to the outcome based on the logic, we’d love to hear it!

I’ve attached the list of questions (word file) and an excel file containing the mapping of the combined answers (ignore columns M onwards for now) to inform the outcome of the workflow.  You’ll note question 1 does not have a corresponding ‘likelihood’ question associated with it, and therefore this is mapped directly into the pathways/outcomes table as A, B, C, D or E.  There is also a question 6, which does not require mapping (it will simply help inform a step in the process).



Management of Change Workflow

Caveat: You will see in the notes tab there are a few areas under development however I have given samples of data and logic to enable to estimation.  

Very important to note: these are very specific mostly based around a tool we had in place, tell the team to be create to explore our fundamental requirement of ease of use for our frontline staff."

This is a fast deployment with an end of June the cut off date to have everything live and fully functioning. They are interested in having a managed trial and also in getting pricing for professional services.

They expect to run about 5,000 of these a year but have other projects they will look to deploy this solution into as well.

In addition to the market research above, David and Serdar are looking to assess how/if this can be ideally achieved with an 'off the shelf' solution or leveraging Microsoft power apps

Business Challenge: 
Struggle/Gap currently is that there is a requirement for the form to be prefilled by information both relative to the client as well as the care worker completing the form eg. If a care worker is onsite seeing a patient/client then the solution should look to prefill this information that is relative and critical to both parties 

Additionally, the above needs to be accessed and responsive on a mobile device with the ability to both capture images/photos as well as sketches that may be performed by the care worker (eg. Incident involving someone falling out of a wheelchair, it can be captured and attached to the incident/workflow) 

App specifically for this doesn't need to be created however the mobile responsiveness needs to be there for both execution and adoption experience"	"I've attached the Incident Report form that CatholicCare are looking at automating as a primary use case if that helps in forming a demonstration

Straight out of the gate said that he is keen to implement off the shelf workflow automation tools as opposed to develop them himself and had heard about Nintex and PA.
Had a chat to him about the functionality of NAC and he was quite impressed. Asked for a sandbox to play around with but then we decided to set up a session with a pre-sales engineer to go through a walkthrough demo and of the tool and to answer any technical questions before providing a trial licence.

Has direct access to all their databases and is capable of building any integrations himself.

Some use cases he described:

Client rings up to ask for some gardening to be done. And the moment it comes in and the gardening request comes into the customer service offices, they then have to go and try and find a gardner who's available. And then they would speak to the CS to I would leave it with the, so the rostering team to be able to try and figure out a time when they're available. If and then there's a whole bunch of conditions, if that's not available, then they would try and reorganize someone else's roster to be able to make the available. Otherwise they might go back to… the stuff the client and suggest alternate times and et cetera. So, so the request that comes external request comes in and gets bounced around between basically three or four key groups within here based on conditions of whether you're they are able to complete it or not. And then ultimately, you send some kind of communication back to the client and fill the shift in our rostering system and send a notification out to the team member.

For context at this point, we are looking for a process documenting tool which is interactive to complement the ERP implementation we are undertaking.
 
To begin with it will be a tool utilized by the project team to develop future state processes in which will be interactive rather than documented procedures in word/pdf or static visio style process mapping. Your process discovery and mapping module looks very suitable for this. We are looking for easy to create and use, intuitive, and of course supporting simple electronic forms/checklists and weblinks to forms etc within our ERP.
 
In the session next week, we want an overview of what Promapp does and how. We definitely want a demo, at least a half hour, and live (not powerpoints or videos please!) - we are visual people and all want to get in the weeds a bit, so demo will help us see how simple this product is to use and generate questions.
 
A bit on pricing model would be great too – we will most likely want a quote post this session.

A lot of processes are manual and paper heavy.
Eduardo saw Process Manager at Launceston but then Nintex Workflow Automation was discussed in an internal meeting. He said they are looking for some low hanging fruit and thinks automating some processes with external facing forms could achieve that. 
Step one is to have a Nintex Overview/General WF demo/Disco call with their team to educate them on what Nintex is and what we can do. Eduardo sent me some form examples and its definitely our bread and butter. 
The main one if their Notice of Intention form. I have attached below. 

I get the sense that the contact we will be talking with won't be that automation savvy so we will need to educate and hold their hand a bit. He said the reason that this type of project hadn't gotten off the ground before was due to lack of resources and ability. Eduardo also said that there will be some new hires in the conversation as well. 

I also sent him some examples of external facing NAC forms and he liked them.

He also said that he will be getting some more details on what the processes behind these forms. I will get them and send them over. Potentially could be able to do a full demo if it's not complex a process.

Attached is a workflow of the New Supplier Onboarding process, the supplier form and screen shots of the digital form used internally.

A summary of the steps for a new supplier is as follows:
1.	DV staff member emails form (ref F06.2a - Supplier Masterfile Data Form - New Supplier.pdf to the supplier)
2.	Supplier completes form and emails to DV staff
3.	DV staff initiates an internal digital form (ref K06.1 Supplier Creation or Update Request - Digital Form.png) checks for completeness, accuracy and authorisation and submits. 
Despite initiator ticking the box for having checked details for accuracy, details like entity name are not always correct and the form is returned to be sent to the supplier.

Note:  Workflow logic is built into the form that then routes the digital form to various staff/groups responsible for validating, setting up, approving and activating the supplier in our finance system, TechnologyOne.

4.	Various members from our internal Finance and Audit Control team members will create the supplier record, validate via ABN/ASIC/Google search checks and perform a verbal confirmation with the supplier of details.  Approval in the digital form moves it to the next step in the process.
5.	Checks and approval by the Group Head
6.	Final check, approval and supplier activation by the Financial Accountant Supplier the finance system

The reason the pdf form is emailed to the supplier is because our digital form is within our Microsoft 365 tenancy and we don’t allow any guest access.

Faizal has sent 3 processes they automate at th moment, and would like to see a demo of these in NWC. I think we can pick one of the following, though the one that uses the most of our tools. Please see below;

1)Maas Hardware Orders

Systems Used – Excel, Outlook

•	Read outlook email to check if we received a Rollout Form(which is an excel)
•	If received, then place the rollout form in the file folder.
•	Then validate the excel sheet if there are any duplicates, any missing information in the columns.
•	Then the BOT needs to create various order forms(which is excel again) using a order template(excel) and the Rollout form(form) by using the filtering on couple of couples.
•	Once created, we have to send these individual order forms to a team for them to approve or reject
•	If they approve, they send back the Dispatch notification to the robot mailbox
•	The bot which runs every 30mins check if there are any dispatch notifications and then grabs few details from the attachment and add back to the Rolloutform.
•	And then forward the dispatch notification to individual emails  
•	And at the end of process if then again looks if there anymore particular column which are empty, it checks if the activation date has been breached,  if breached it sends an email notification

2)Siebel Number Transfer 

Systems Involved – Siebel UI(CRM), Outlook, API

This process is a number transfer process from postpay to postpay or prepay to postpay in our Siebel CRM system, all the actions are mostly done via using CRM UI, apis and executes query from the Siebel DB.
Some high level steps,

•	Validates if the msisdn and account are under the same for example calling a DB query 
•	Disconnects the connection on the Siebel UI
•	Creates an post2pre order on the Siebel UI
•	Supresses notification using and api
•	Sends an email notification

3)BAT

Systems Used – WINSCP, ZIP file, Run macros, Excel, Outlook, Zafira UI


•	Downloads the sample accounts list from WINSCP and then runs a process on a Zafira tool which send an email to the robot mailbox
•	Extracts the report ID and downloads the list of csvs and pdfs from the WINSCP desktop application.
•	Unzips the folder
•	Executes the macro
•	Send the list of successful, failed list to the finance team"	"That migrating (which they seem happy to have done by us) will not lose any of their current capability, and in fact enhance what they are doing."

This is the most pressing need. I chatted to him about Nintex automation in general and he was interested to assess NAC as well as they struggle with a lack of resourcing when it come to automation and was interested by the concept.

The play here is to do a Kryon RPA demo and then show him a bit of NAC so he understands the differences.

He could purchase an RPA tool as soon as December if it fits the needs for the finance dep.

1.Process Repository -  Process Capture and Maintenance (version control) 
- Simplicity and Steps
- Adding a Video / Work Instruction Document onto a Step
- Linking Visual Process Maps to display in Sharepoint – embedded links.  Making Sharepoint to Promapp links.
2. Process Improvement
– receiving and managing feedback, involving the business / process users.
- Demonstrate the exchange from ‘Feedback’ to ‘Conclusion’ 
3. User Roles; 
- Process Owner
- Process Expert
- Process ‘User’
- Risk Owner

Include Role types and how this contributes to Process Analysis ($, Process Step Times, Cost of Process)
Highlighting Accountability and Approval flows
4. Process Analysis 
- deeper dive into Systems, Lean (tags), Process Cost, Identification of inefficient/ineffective (non value add) steps.
- wait (lead) time versus active time (effort)

5. Change Management Benefits
- benefits of System in process to identify all process steps undertaken in ERP for example.  (impacts of system change)

5. Training
- how we use Promapp to create and deliver Training Modules, as an important feature of enablement
- how we track use  of training modules by User.

6. Risk Management
- how Promapp provides tangible control over organisational risks.
- how to identify a Process control as related to a known Organisational Obligation (Obligation – Risk – Control IP)
- Risk Owner role, approval flows

7. Automation
- the functions in Promapp that support identification of Automation
- Any Automation tools that work with Promapp.

& 

If we could please cover the following:
1.	Process Approval workflow, if possible to send to multiple approvers & track approval status (I understand that sequential approval process is not yet available)
2.	The built in glossary functionalities
3.	How we would share a process Document with an external party (business partners)

And anything that you could showcase from the point of view of the ‘visitor’ (or a new learner or a senior executive!) to the site, how they would navigate & search for a process, tips & tricks etc.
This would be transformative change for our business, in terms of process management, so a successful user engagement rate will be a key focus.

o	Journey mapping 
o	Customer data 
o	Legacy system swap out
o	Legacy process review 
o	Documenting processes (currently have Holocentric)

We don’t have a single central view of Member Experience involved activity, nor a transparent view of workforce allocation and capacity. A system which can integrate with other (PPM ) applications so we can get an Enterprise View of our Workforce utilization.
Resolution of this problem requires creating a sustainable view of demand and resource that can be used in next to real time to support decisions around the prioritisation of workload or the utilisation of skilled team members. 
Currently the team is using CRM, GRC (An incident management system) JIRA, Mailbox for Triage and Allocation of work, which is intensely manual and prone to fluctuations in volume. We have no elapsed time monitoring & effort capture, and no volume and Arrival capture, hence we can’t monitor the utilization(Over or Under), cannot readily establish resource capacity, cannot forecast effectively and cannot proactively mitigate risk via informed reprioritization.
-	Inbox – 
o	General adhoc questions (eg: Questions about how the product works, Queries on current incidents we're working on etc, General updates from other teams on requests made from the inbox - such as Business Rule updates or process improvements etc.)
o	Complaints - Complaint summaries requiring Trustee review/approval, Work rating complaints, Premium refund complaints, Default cover complaints, Lapsed cover complaints
o	Underwriting requests - Escalations for member queries such as lapsed cover, cancelled cover etc
o	Insurer queries - Responses to escalation queries, Responses to incident queries, Queries regarding issues, Notification of errors or issues (such as with TAL's online tools)
o	LINK - Incident updates, Queries on incidents and other processes/rules, Responses to incident queries and other ad-hoc requests from the Fund, Notification of incidents, Responses regarding commercial agreements as part of incidents, Requests for updates to processes/rules,
JIRA – Received requests from couple of frontdoor (landing page for demand across the organisation)

Drove value of BPM in pipeline of automation work and asked for more specific requirements: 

As discussed, here are some common major pain-points experienced by Finance and OTI together, as follows:

1)	Match off the SAP invoices to the Manual invoices. Reconcile the payments.
2)	Find the correct or current customer contact person who is responsible approve the PO or invoice. (Email and phone no)
3)	Credit or invoice write off agreed by sales but not processed in SAP. Therefore, invoices still showing outstanding
4)	Some invoices were not correctly uploaded in the Invoice portal that customer required.
5)	Example: AUpost and Startrack invoices they were entered under same customer no. Invoices need to be manual sent by OTI to different email address and quote different PO no.
6)	Sometimes the correct PO no was not indicated on the invoice, therefore invoice got rejected.
7)	Legal issues caused by the customer paid via 3rd party or interbank causing potential money laundering concern.
8)	Different plant no (SAP auto split line items)
9)	Different routing no ( SAP auto split line items )
10)	Different service contract no attached to sales order ( SAP auto split line items)

Whereas, customer issue One PO, some of customer are prefer one invoice to match one PO.  For the customer, it is confusing if we issue multiple invoices for their PO. Therefore, for the convenience or contract requirement of the customer, we manually invoice as per milestones. I have attached some process flowcharts that can help you better understand how some core activities occur within the business related to AR and sale of service maintenance contracts.

a.	Process Name
b.	Introduction: This section may include background information, describe the purpose of the process, and explain the process scope. A scope statement can include both what is and is not included in a process. You may also choose to include an applicability matrix for a quick, visual guide to the process scope and roles involved.
c.	Process Inputs: Identify what input or need triggers the start of the process.
d.	Process Boundaries: Define clear parameters for where a process begins and ends.
e.	Process Flow: Use a flowchart or list all of the tasks involved in a process and their organization. Providing a visual illustration of the steps in a process can help readers quickly understand how it flows from start to finish.
f.	Process Outputs: This may be an actual product or less tangible result, but all processes have a purpose that they are designed to achieve. An output may actually be outside of the defined boundaries of a process, but knowing the expected outcome is relevant to understanding a process.
g.	Exceptions: Outline the exception management process, which is how exceptions to the normal process flow will be handled when they arise.
h.	Roles and Responsibilities: Multiple people may be responsible for carrying out different aspects of a business process. Include a list all of the roles and their associated responsibilities so that it’s clear who to contact when a problem occurs or a change needs to be implemented. Some process documents include a decision matrix to illustrate who can make decisions about different elements of a process.
i.	Process Approval: Outline procedures for reviewing, revising, and approving process documents.
2.	Variant Flow – Copy existing and set up variant for Chinese Language
3.	Explain Roles and Responsibilities in Promapp
4.	Cycle Costing – explain how Longson can use this tool to validate cycle cost of As-Is Processes against To-Be processes
5.	Explain the dashboard and how Leaders and IT can utilize this and how end users can use this to communicate details about the process to process responsible

Using Hollocentric for QMS and BPM and it isn't working - in particular as the team who built this up have almost all left.  Team engagement is really poor with Hollocentric.  Key stakeholder is mapping out current state big picture next week.  We are taking her through a managed trial / demo to help support this after they workshop big data flows. Also using CIRAM - by Bay Tech which is about to be shelfed so they need to migrate ASAP to a BPM and compliance tool. 


A couple of business cases for Automation:
1. Investigators out on site recording multi-media evidence and then collating into a system.  This isn't being recorded well and they need factual data like when / time it was recorded to use in court for prosecution. 
2. App created in Power Automate:  Helps teams work out the best way to get to different site locations in a  day...


Client detailed: Attached is the presentation about the spatial app.  No worries if that is not our sort of thing.  Of much more interest is the evidence gathering, the investigation process (turning that evidence into a brief which seems to me to be a very clearand strict process but which we have a belief that we need very specialised software for) replacing Holocentric, and bringing our processes to life.  The main contender if you want to have a look at it is Comtrac (because they specialise in legal investigation process and have a very strong sense of access control and security) and Pega (because it is in the department).  

I will send you the information about those things as soon as possible. This is a really interesting bunch of work and it sounds like our timing will be perfect.

Can you remind me what police you said you had worked with?  Our legal/investigation team (mostly ex crown solicitors and cops) a very top priority here and they are very compromised by our current systems.  They arent very technical and they feel very much not properly understood so if I could tell them that Nintex has worked successfully wiht a police organisation that would buy us a huge amount of confidence. 

The key problem is that they gather evidence and there is a delay while it sits in various places (mostly on carry around hard drives) until they can get itno the office to transfer it to Sharepoint.  The 2 major complications are that the guys are often in the field and working on their mobile hotspot or no internet connection at all until they get back to the office, and secondly they are often working with very large files (the other day they had a 14GB video file)."

Cassie has come through on the COVID19 campaign we are running.
Currently Wyndham city On boarding system has a workflow for a new starter. This is fine at the moment and running well. The gap is the changing of position.
Wanting a streamline electronic workflow - In regards to position and placement changes.

Use Case Example:
Scenario #1: Currently Cassie is on a certain level and position, for example an admin, at a band 4. Just got a new job opp, placement will change to legal officer at band 6
Band = pay level

Scenario #2: Change to work pattern, no longer want to be a full time employee, want to be partime, boss has accepted, go through all the necessary information verbally, that then gets adjusted and goes to payroll

We want a form that can basically simply change 1-2 bits of information and that's all they need to fill out. Currently we have a form and they need to fill in all this information even if it is not necessary for that particular change.

Authority:
Cassie will be the main point of contact going forward. Kimberely will also be included in the meetings.
They stated they won't need anyone else as part of the decision making process.

Openess to change:
They are looking to implement sooner rather than later. In terms of specific time frame, they were not too concerned. Whether it is Jan, Feb, etc, not really as big of an issue."
